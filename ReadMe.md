# Distributed Version System

While doing research for this project, I ran into [IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs), which is nearly identical to the DVS concept. Hats off to @jbenet for stumbling into this concept first and doing a great job so far. 

IPFS seems to lack a few features, for which I have filed issues. Because it is much more mature, I suggest using IPFS. Hopefully these features will be supported soon (if they aren't already):

- https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs/issues/68
- https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs/issues/69

I will direct my efforts toward IPFS and applications built on top of it.
